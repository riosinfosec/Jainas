Age : 36

Description: Nearly six feet, her posture relaxed yet commanding—a presence shaped by confidence rather than force. Her red hair, a cascade of copper and ember hues, fell in loose waves just past her shoulders, with a few silver strands glinting like frost under the light. Her complexion was fair and freckled, the kind of skin that hinted at cold northern winds and sunlit fjords.
Her eyes were a sharp glacier blue, observant and steady, framed by fine lines that deepened when she smiled—which was rare, but always genuine
