==Jaina== went to her quarters, the lights didn’t come on, she walked toward the panel, the she felt it small but enough of a change in air pressure to defend herself against her assailant. The kick came in microns later, she grabbed the leg and used it to pull it and the attached body toward her using the momentum of the kick. Her assailant countered and used her grapple to close the distance, ==jaina== reacted and outstretched her hand right into her assailants through gripping it tight. “I see your form has not improved Marc,Lights” The lights in her room turned on. She released her grip “You were always the best in close quarter combat in the academy it looks like you still are” Marc struggled as he massaged his throat.

“Its been too long Marc” “Too long” they embraced.

Marc then went to the table in ==jainas== quarters. “Shes back ==Jaina==”

She was spotted on ==kronos== IV,

were is she now

I wish i knew she lost her tail

Do you think the ==govenor== is involved in this, i told the council not to give him asylum.

Actually the governor was found dead, shot in cold blood

But that is the least of our worries she made off with all the contents in the armory as well as the entire Planetary defense corps.

How could she just waltz right into the palace.

When we find the captain of the planetary forces well ask him

So she has an army weapons and we have her last known location. What are we waiting for.

“Hold on ==Jaina==, I had Intelligence HQ send you because I knew you had the ability to get to me sooner.”

“So what am I Marc just a messenger”

“You know how the council is data of this magnitude has to be hand delivered, the council doesn’t believe in ==holo-transmissions==, plus you should be back to the capital within a month”

==Jaina== smirked “Less I plotted a new jump route”

“Well look who is being a smart-ass”

“Shut up,will you be staying long?”

“Sorry I can’t, need to get back on ==Veoilas== tail”

“Bye Marc”

They embraced and Marc stepped out making his way to the hanger bay.

==Jaina== put the intel pack in her safe and stepped back and made her way back to the bridge.

“==Cap’n== on deck” shouted the X.O.

“At ease men, Helmsmen set a jump course for ==Aseth== using the new plot and make the first jump as soon as the Agents ship is clear”

“Aye ==cap’n==”

“Ensign you have the bridge, ==XO== ==phillips== follow me please”

Both ==Jaina== and ==phillips== walked to out to the corridor.

Phillips was about to speak, ==jaina== cut him off.

“Phillips I know you are new to my command, so I will only say this once, the bridge is not the place to voice your opinions, I will take them now”

“That was a risky maneuver you performed”

“I know there is more than that, this is your opportunity to speak freely”

“The crew is in violation of many nation fleet regulations regarding discipline”

“==EXO== what you don’t realize is that this vessel is mine, it is not owned by the nation, the crew was hand selected by me including yourself I see great leadership potential in you don’t prove me wrong.”

“I just want to make sure we have disciplined men aboard.”

“If your fear is a security breech, know that everyone aboard my crew has subjected themselves to the ==Sliv== ==Kel== as you and I have.”

“==EXO== I see great potential in you but you must learn that managing a ==starship== is not just rules and regulations.”

“ A lesson I will take to heart, ==Cap’n== if I may make a personal inquiry”

“ You want to know my past with Marc.”

“Yeah basically”

“Well before I joined the fleet I was a ==cyper== agent like our last visitor and meet ==marc== while in the academy on ==Aseth==”

“==Whu== leave intelligence, you have so much freedom on your assignments.”

“I don’t know how much you’ve noticed the advanced technology aboard the ship”

I have yes”

“While ==phillips== it’s all my design and when I designed it i could not see anyone ==captining== it but me, so i requested a transfer.”

“So you invented this new ship design”

“I did and when i transferred my rank moved with me”

“Well goodnight EX get some sleep i will relieve the ensign and you can relieve me when you wake.”

==Veoila== took over manual control of the ship and lowered it into the atmosphere of planet ==U068== or as she referred it to home. The planet was discovered years ago, but deemed uninhabitable for the expensive cost of ==terraforming== the planet. But what lie underneath complex extinct lava flow tunnels created an atmosphere breathable and suitable for life. She landed the ship in an extinct volcano, and opened the exit ramp. As she exited she was approached by her two advisors brothers from the planet ==Scalia==. Universally known to produce the best military advisors aside from ==Veoila== herself, the brothers approached her.

“Did you acquire the men and the weapons?”

“Of course I did, did you think i was on a pleasure cruise.”

“Just making sure it was completed.”

“Whatever, get the droids to unload the cargo and take the new recruits to their quarters.”

“Yes mam, we have reports of our raid activity since you’ve been away.”

“Meet me at my meditation chamber in a half hour, you can brief me then.”

“Yes” the brothers responded in unison with contempt. They hated working for her but they knew that in time she would drop her guard and then they could strike and claim all that they believed they had worked hard for not her.
