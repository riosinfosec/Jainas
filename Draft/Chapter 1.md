The water felt warm as ==Jaina==, braced herself against the shower wall. ==Jaina== reached for the shower controls and shut off the shower. She grabbed a towel and wiped the fog from the mirror. Her new body felt awkward she had not had the time to spend the normal acclimation period, before departing on the her mission. She stood tall at nearly six feet, her posture relaxed yet commanding—a presence shaped by confidence rather than force. Her red hair, a cascade of copper and ember hues, fell in loose waves just past her shoulders, with a few silver strands glinting like frost under the light. Her complexion was fair and freckled, the kind of skin that hinted at cold northern winds and sunlit fjords.

Her eyes were a sharp glacier blue, observant and steady, framed by fine lines that deepened when she smiled—which was rare, but always genuine. Her chronometer chirped, her ship should be arriving at the designated coordinates within the hour. She strapped on her chronometer, adorned her uniform and walked to the bridge. She walked from her quarters to the bridge offering salutes to the crew as she passed. The security doors to the bridge opened and she stepped in. The bridge of the ==50-tonner== star ship _Nautilus_ pulsed with energy and purpose. Soft blue lighting lined the angular walls, casting a glow over the sleek metal surfaces. Dozens of crew members moved with practiced efficiency, each stationed at consoles that buzzed with streams of data, holographic maps, and flickering readouts.

“==Cap’n== on the bridge!” shouted her 1st officer,

“Good evening, at ease,” ==Jaina== said.

==Veolia== ran through the streets, she knew she was being followed, she had spotted them when she first arrived on the planet. “lets have some fun boys, ==veolia== muttered under her breath as she ducked into a ==cantina==. She found the nearest window and pushed it, she then crept to a shadowy booth in the corner, right away a server droid came and tried to peddle the ==cantina== goods to her. ==Veoilia== swiped through the menu on the server droids display. She kept the droid busy, it blocked her from view of the entrance. Her pursuers entered the ==cantina== saw the swinging window, took a quick glance around the ==cantina==, and made a mad dash to the alleyway behind the bar where the window was located. She then ordered a local brew she figured she earned at least that much for her efforts. The server droid, brought the drink to her, she soon realized she deserved more than the local brew. She then hacked the server droid and placed the drink on someone else tab. She stepped out of the bar and caught the first taxi,

“Where to?” the skiff pilot ==gruffed== at her?

“Civic-gardens, make it fast.”

==Veolia== stepped off the taxi skiff, she made the short walk through the gardens to the entrance of the planetary estate. “Halt,state your business!” Barked on the the security officers at the gate.

“Why gentleman no need, I am the HQ auditor t my name is Lori here is my ==Ident==. Card.”

“The guard took it and ran it through the reader”

“Error!” exclaimed the reader.

The guard slid it again “identification confirmed” chirped the machine.

Her forger would get to live a little longer it seemed.

“Sorry for the delay miss,” the guard holding her ==ident== cart responded apologetically.

“No worries gentlemen have a good day”

==Veoila== walked straight to the governors audience chambers, She was stopped by an aid in an ==imacculate== suit, the ==governers== personal aide she assumed. " Hello my name is Lori, I am the Auditor sent from ==Jision== Prime, may you please announce me for the governor so I can begin my Audit.” She stepped in to the audience chambers.

“Good ==even’n== ==gov’nr==” ==Jaina== said mocking the cockney accent.

The ==governer== jumped out of his chair.

“Who dared let this bottom feeder into my inner sanctum.”

“Well you can start with those two ==numbskulls== you have out front”

“Get out you’ve caused enough trouble already, leave or i will place you in holding cell and turn your over to the Nation”

‘Ah yes the nation see that is why ==im== here you made me a promise before you sold your people out to the nation, ==im== just here to collect”

“I owe you nothing, guards detain her”

No on in the room moved.

“As you see governor no one obeys the commands of a Nations lap dog.”

“Men i order you to seize this criminal”

The captain of the guard walked in.

“Mathias my good friend, get you men under control”

“Sorry ==governer== you betrayed us to the very evil we fought against, we no longer take orders from you as we’ve found one more loyal to our cause.”

“==Dont== you understand Mathias with her all you get is death.”

“Do not try and sway me my choice has been made give us the weapons promised and we shall leave.”

“Fine go with this Bitch, but i will hunt you and her down and i will start with your wives and ==childr==-”

The governor fell back into his chair with a bolt to the chest and Mathias standing there with smoking gun. “Come my lady ill take you to the armory and we can be off this dreadful planet.”

At the center, the captain stood on a raised platform, arms folded behind their back, eyes locked on the main view screen—a sprawling vista of nothingness, they had arrived at the space between spaces. Around her, officers called out updates in clipped tones

“Sir we have arrived at the designated coordinates, may we be told of our mission.”

==Jaina== ==noded== to the ==coms== officer, “==Shipwide== ==coms== please”, the ==coms== came crackling to life

==Jaina== noticed the crew was on edge, it had been a long four weeks of travel getting to this sector. The sector was only recently re-discovered so no safe ==hyperlanes== have been mapped yet. She worked with the ==navigtors== and the ==nav-computer== calculating all the jumps needed to arrive here. She saved every jump in the ==nav-computer== and she knew when it was done compiling, the computer would deem it a safe ==hyperane==.

“==Cap’n== we’ve reached the co-ordinates, primary long range scans picked up ==nothin==” chimed in the comm officer. ==Jaina== responded

“Raise shields, engineering divert all available power to shields and weapons, ==shipwide== broadcast please Lt.”

“Aye channels open.”

“All stations on alert, we ==dont== know what could be waiting out here, I know you are tired but stay alert, Captain out”

“Lt. ==Tuono== power up turbo lasers and increase power to lasers to 200%”

“==Cap’n==?”

“==Dont== worry Lt. I wont blow us up.”

“Radar control, bring up your screen, tactical turbo laser readouts as well”

“Lt. ==Tuono== vent energy from cannons when it reaches 200%, and give me a 5 second countdown before”

“Aye ==cap’n==, be advised we will have no lasers until they recharge again.”

“I know just be ready.”

“==Comms== open a channel to hanger bay 4 control tower, aye ==cap’n==”

“Bay 4 have your tractor beam on and ready to target my coordinates.”

“Aye ==capn==, tractor beam coming online, and…were ready”

The tension in the room was building on the bridge no one knew what was going on.

Lt. ==Tuono== broke the tension, “==Cap’n== were venting cannons in 5…4…3…2…1…Venting”

There is was as bright as day on the radar screen, a stingray class vessel but only for a micron as the energy wave passed over the vessel. No one would see it unless you knew what to look for.

“Tractor control lock on to coordinates, 72 beta, 31 Alpha, 571 Zulu.”

“==Cap’n== why are we ==waisting== energy there is nothing there” questioned the ==exo==

“Tractor reports good snare ==cap’n== yelled the ==comms== officer,”

“ Thank you, ==comms== broadcast on all channels and ==frequncy==”

“Unidentified stingray vessel, you’ve ==encrouched== upon the defense ==perimiter== of this vessel, ==un-cloak== and identify ==yourselfve== or well have no choice but to fire upon you.”

“focus weapons on the bell of the snare, once again uncloak and identify or be destroyed”

Then a ship appeared out of what seemed nothing,

“Captain were getting a response”

“on screen please” a young man appeared, looking ==dishevled== wearing clothes that resembled a space pirate. The disheveled space pirate greeted ==jaina==.

“Good day captain, how have you been ==Jaina== it been a long time”

“Captain you know this ==scoundral==”

“==Exo== watch your speech around an ==INtelligenc== ==eofficer==”

==Jaina== I have ==infrmation== vital to our cause” ==intteruppted== the ==sranger== before ==jaina== could go on.

“max you can ==briegf== me in my quarters.”

“Lt. have a ==securitry== team dispatched the the ==HAnger== 4 to escort the agent to my quarters.”

==Exo== you have the bridge, and ==exo== we shall have words later”

Aye ==capn==

“Dismissed”
